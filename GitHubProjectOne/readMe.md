#GRIDLOCK! 
###Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Driving In New York!

##Technologies Used: 
1. jQuery, 
2. Google chrome (esp the developer tools)

##Approach Taken:
I approached the game like an equation: first I figured out the order of the variables, operators, etc, then figured out what the component parts were. Once I understood what the process had to be, I then created the smallest of the building blocks--the actions that would take place on each key click. Then I created the functions that contained the intervals, then determined how to cycle through the intervals, before placing those functions inside of a function that activated on a click or key press.
